# Orchard Analytics Query

## Instructions
1. 


## Examples

Came across reference to a disease I had not heard of (Schimke Immuno-osseous Dysplasia) and looked it up on Orchard. We have NEVER reviewed a pair (Has top scores in the 0.98 range). Is there a way to know the percentage of diseases that have had at least 1 pair reviewed?
